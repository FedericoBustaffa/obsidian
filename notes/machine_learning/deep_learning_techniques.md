# Deep Learning Techniques

In order to train a deep neural networks standard appraches and techniques are
not enough. In the past training was done by pre-training but nowadays there are
better way to train a model end-to-end for a specific task.

The main issues with deep neural networks are related to the gradient, that can
become too small or too big depending on weights magnitude. Multiplication
through many layers can cause these issues causing the failure of training.
