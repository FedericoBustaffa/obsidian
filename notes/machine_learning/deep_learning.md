# Deep Learning

**Deep learning** is mainly referred to a multi-layer implementation of neural
networks:

- Multi-layer perceptron
- Convolutional neural networks
- Recurrent neural networks

It introduces some new interesting concepts like **representation learning** and
**distributed representation**. Now is possible to have a **hierarchical**
features represtation through layers, that generally goes from rough to finer
level of representation.
