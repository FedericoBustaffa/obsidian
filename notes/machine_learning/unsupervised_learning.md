# Unsupervised Learning

The **unsupervised learning** paradigm is quite different from the _supervised_
one; in this approach examples are **not labeled**, so there is no _error_ in
the model output.

It's not even possible to properly talk about _prediction error_ because the aim
of unsupervised learning is not to predict but is to catch underlying structures
in the input data. Usually we are talking about **clusering** and
**dimensionality reduction** tasks (**representation learning**).
