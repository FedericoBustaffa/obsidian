# Decision Tree

The **decision tree** model can be used for both classification and regression
tasks; howhever its structure suggests a propensity for classification.

Their intrinsic tree representation also makes them easily interpretable,
providing critical points where their classification changes; that's why they
are also widely used in Explainable AI.
