# Probabilistic Reasoning over Time

Many real world applications are not static, they need a **continual learning**
approach. Under this vision of the modelled world we can have two type of
changes:

- **Virtual drift**: the world keeps expanding but everything is happened before
  remains valid.
- **Real drift**: the concepts change and the concepts happened before are not
  valid anymore.

In this sense we need a more powerful model capable of handling **changes over
time**.

## Hidden Markov Model

The **hidden Markov model** is of course based on **Markov chains**

### Inference

### Filtering

### Smoothing

### Viterbi Algorithm
