# Uncertainty

Real world problems contain uncertainty due to partial observability,
nondeterminism or adversaries.

In large domain contexts we may fail to predict well what to do for three main
reasons:

- **Lazyness**: it is too much work to list the complete set of antecedents or
  consequents needed to ensure an exceptionless rule.
- **Theoretical ignorance**: there is no complete theory for the domain.
- **Practical ignorance**: even if all the rules are known, there's still
  uncertainty due to the fact that all the necessary tests are not o cannot be
  done.

An agent has only a _degree of belief_ in the relevant sentences and the
rational decision depends on both the **relative importance** of various goals
and the **likelihood** that they will be achieved.
