# Planning

In the classical way of **planning** the aim is to find a **sequence of
actions** to accomplish a goal in a discrete, deterministic, static and fully
observable environment.

This is already done by agents via search algorithms or by logical agents via
inference, and there are ad-hoc languages to implement this kind of stuff, like
**planning domain definition language (PDDL)**.

In this kind of languages it is possible represent a combinatorial number of
actions with a single schema, and in the end return a _plan_.
