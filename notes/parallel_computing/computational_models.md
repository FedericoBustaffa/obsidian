# Computational Models

Various models have been developed to analyse and evaluate parallel algorithms
performances and also to define lower and upper bounds to them.

## Models

- [[work_span]]
- [[pram]]
- [[bsp]]

### Comparison

| Models    | Pros                      | Cons                        |
| --------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Work-Span | Analytic and simple       | Communication not accounted |
| PRAM      | Ideal, strong theory base | Not realistic               |
| BSP       | Communication accounted   | More difficult to use       |
