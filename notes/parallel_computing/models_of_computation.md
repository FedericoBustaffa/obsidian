# Models Of Computation

In order to better reason about algorithms and their theoritical performances,
**models of computation** were defined. Typically ideal models where overhead
and heterogeneity of hardware is not taken into account or modelled as something
constant and simply predictable.

The three main models of computation are **work span**, **pram** and **bulk
synchronous parallel**, each characterizing some aspect of an algorithm and
theoretical performance or resource usage.
