# Linear Algebra

Generally speaking, the **linear algebra** defines rules to manipulate
**vectors** by adding them together and multiply them by a scalar.

A vector can be many things, the most known type of vector is denoted as
$\vec{v}$ and it is used typically in physics; it can be seen as $n$-dimensional
point such that there is an _arrow_ starting from the origin and pointing in
that exact point. Also polynomials are vectors, but in machine learning they are
seen as elements of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
