# Complex Systems

A **complex system** often refers to a system composed of simple units, each
exhibiting **individual behavior**. However, when these simple units are placed
within the same system, they **interact**, giving rise to particular group
behaviors known as **emergent** phenomena.

A **computational model** is typically used to represent a complex system,
allowing certain behaviors to emerge through numerical simulations.

The variables in these models evolve over time in a **discrete** or
**continuous** manner, and simulations can be either **deterministic** or
**stochastic**.

This type of study is generally contrasted with _data-driven_ approaches (such
as Machine Learning), providing instead a _knowledge-driven_ approach, which
requires fewer data but much deeper knowledge of the system being studied.
